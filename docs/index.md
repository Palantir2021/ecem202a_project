# Abstract

The objective of this project is to build a system to detect and warn obstacles for visually impaired people to improve their outdoor mobility. As a new choice in the market of such devices, this obstacle avoidance system is expected to be low-cost, user-friendly and robust. IR camera and ultrasonic modules are used to detect the environment, whose data is processed by Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense respectively. The processed data is sent to a controller Arduino, which then sends message to a smartphone application who can vocally remind the user about the obstacles through earphone. The test results showed that the system has a high obstacle detection rate, while the response time is a satisfactory 3 to 9 seconds, with which a user can walk in a speed of 2 to 3 seconds per step.
